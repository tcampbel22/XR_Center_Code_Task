## Tarot Card App ‚Äì UI/UX Improvements & Game Concepts

### Changes Made to the Existing Tarot Card App

- Moved the "Deal" buttons to the center and scaled them up for easier interaction.
- Centered the deck and positioned it at the top of the screen.
- Created a grid layout for dealt cards and added a hover animation effect.
- Changed overall colour scheme to match the cards.

### Suggestions for Further UI/UX Improvements

- Display card names underneath each dealt card.
- Show additional card information (e.g., stats, facts, or descriptions) when a card is clicked or pressed.
- Add a discard pile visual effect for removed cards.
- Implement drag-and-drop discard functionality, along with a "Discard All" button.
- Convert image assets to lightweight formats like `.webp` to minimize load times.
- Include user settings to toggle animations for better performance or accessibility.
- Add music 

## Gamification Concepts

### üß† Memory Game (Beginner)

- Display 12 cards in a grid (6 pairs of matching Arcana cards).
- The user must match all pairs within 10 turns.
- Every second level reduces the number of available turns by one.

### ‚ô†Ô∏è Suit Collector (Intermediate)

- A suit (Wands, Cups, Swords, or Pentacles) is randomly selected at the start.
- The user must draw and collect all cards of the selected suit before the deck runs out.
- The user can draw 1‚Äì7 cards per turn.
- A discard pile shows only the top card.
- Once per turn, the user may retrieve the top discard card.
- Cards from the selected suit go into a ‚Äúsuit pile‚Äù; others go into the discard pile.
- Score is based on how many cards are left in the deck when the suit is completed.

**Bonus Twist**: The 22 non-suited cards could introduce wildcard effects (e.g., reshuffle the deck, lose your current hand, draw bonus cards, etc.).
